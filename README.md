## Life-cycle
### `onInit` hook

Method onInit() application to initialize a complex component.
Here you can download data from the server or from other data sources.
onInit () does not match the constructor. The constructor can also perform some initialization of the object,
at the same time, something complex in the constructor is not recommended. The constructor should be as simple as possible and perform the most basic initialization. Something more complex, for example, loading data from the server, which can take a long time, is better done in the onInit () method.
